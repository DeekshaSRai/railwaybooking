      <p>Passenger coaches:On long distance routes and also on some shorter routes, IR uses 2 primary types of coach design types. ICF coaches, in production from 1955 until Jan 2018,</p><p> constitute the bulk of the current stock. These coaches, considered to be having inadequate safety features, are slowly being phased out. As of September 2017,</p><p> around 40,000 coaches are still in operation. The older coaches are being replaced with LHB coaches. Introduced in mid '90s, </p><p>these coaches are lighter, safer and are capable of speeds up to 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph).</p><p>IR has announced that two new self-propelled train set designs will be introduced starting from mid 2018. These two train types, termed as Train-18 and Train-20,</p><p> are expected to replace locomotive-hauled trains on long distance routes.</p><p>On regional short distance routes, IR runs Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) or Diesel Electrical Multiple Unit (DEMU) trains, depending on the traction available. </p><p>These train sets are self-propelled with capability for faster acceleration or deceleration and are expected to reduce congestion on dense routes.</p> <p>Passenger locomotive-hauled trains, having frequent stops are slowly being replaced with train sets across India.</p><p>On suburban commuter routes around the large urban centers, IR runs trains with Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches. As of March 2017, about 9100 coaches are in operation</p>
